# Frontend Development Guidelines

> The implemented conventions for the StashSeek Chat same-origin Web client.

---

## Overview

The frontend is a mobile-first React and TypeScript application under `web/`. It is a private video library, not a chat client. FastAPI owns authentication, tenant selection, lifecycle projection, validation, and the OpenAPI contract. React owns presentation, local interaction state, and cached server state.

## Product Boundary

- Supported content: server-saved YouTube URLs plus optional browser-companion
  captures from YouTube and NTULearn/Kaltura.
- Supported routes: `/login`, `/library`, `/videos/:id`, protected
  `/account/link`, and protected `/account/browser-companion`.
- The first-empty Agent message is static copy and must never call an LLM.
- Search segments are not a transcript source. The detail page consumes the
  bounded transcript API, which projects legacy JSON3 and canonical browser
  captures behind one response contract.
- `summary` is optional and hidden when null. YouTube description is labeled as description, never summary.
- Browser requests never contain tenant, user, channel identity, queue task, object key, or internal database IDs.

All frontend specifications are written in English. User-facing copy remains concise Chinese.
